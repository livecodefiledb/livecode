#This is liveCode.

This is a text editor that:

- Is powered by GitHub

- Uses client-side JavaScript

- Has an easy-to-view text editor with HTML syntax highlighting

- Logs everything with GitHub's GIT backend

- Has way too many commits (lol!)

### How does this work?

- It uploads every ten seconds to a GitHub repo

- Magic JS stuff for the text editor GUI. And by that I mean CodeMirror's editor (it is pretty)

- The future viewer will do something with the GitHub file, likely view its source code in an iframe.

#This is liveCode.

This is a text editor that:

- Is powered by GitHub

- Uses client-side JavaScript

- Has an easy-to-view 

- Logs everything with GitHub's GIT backend

- Has way too many commits

### How does this work?

- It uploads most every keystroke to GitHub

- I mean every one. And each letter or two's a commit, even the typos!
